# introduction 

Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider with over 365 million monthly
active users, including 165 million paying subscribers, as of June 2021. Spotify provides access
to over 70 million songs, 2.2 million podcasts and 4 billion playlists. This platform is used to
collect a dataset for training a classification model to be able to predict whether a song was a hit
or not a hit based on different song attributes such as danceability, loudness, duration, etc. 

# Question/need:
Many music artists and producers wonder what makes songs hits or not, what is the perfect
formula for a hit song which will be on billboard and top 100 charts week after week and month
after month. How long should a song be, or how danceable or loud should it be, and which
genres usually get the most love from worldwide listeners to contain the most hits. By doing this
project, these questions will be answered to help guide producers and songwriters understand the
criteria of hit songs.
